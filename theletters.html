                <p>Months after Australia, I had continued to probe and try to learn more about my family history. I took a DNA test that aligned very similarly to
                    the cousins in Australia learning that I was part Vietnamese. This helped confirm that Great Grandfather Rafael Mok was from Vietnam. Additionally,
                    I began to learn more about my Dad's side of the family learning that my Great Great Grandfather was the <a href = "http://chinacomestomit.org/first-boston-chinese">
                    first Chinese American from Boston Chinatown </a>to attend MIT as well as that another Great Great Grandfather immigrated from China going through Ellis Island in which i got to hold his ticket. These
                    small discoveries were continued to peak my interest resulting in me looking through old pictures and artifacts of my families past.

                <p>One random day, I was helping my grandmother move stuff in her basement when I stumbled upon a stack of letters. Opening the letters, dating from 1970 
                    to the 1990s, I held the delicate, stained papers. The letters were from from both Hong Kong and Cuba -- some were from my Great Grandfather, some 
                    were from his children from Cuba, some were written in Chinese, and some were written in English. The letters contained details of my Great Grandfather's 
                    life and the struggles that his children faced in Cuba at that time. These artifacts represented not only America’s history, where John F. Kennedy blockaded Cuba 
                    due to the imminent paranoia of communism, but they were also a reminder of our history.

            <div class="let-paragraph3">
                <p>The letters further supported the stories Aunt Agnes, Ting, and Doris shared with us. The stories were coming together like puzzle pieces that could
                    only be explained by my Great Grandfather himself through letters. But beyond the letters, within this stack of history, were images and artifacts.
                    There was an image of Great Grandfather Rafael which is the only image we have of him. There were pictures of our relatives in Cuba and various packeaging
                    of medicine labels showing the impact and desperation for connection caused by the bloackade. This remnant of history and of my family history, peaked 
                    my curioustiy within myself. It inspired me to reflect and look within myself to discover and embrace intersectionality.
