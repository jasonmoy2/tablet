                <p>In the year of 2018, my family and I ventured to the down under because my brother was studying abroad there. What I didn't know was that I actually
                have a lot of family there. This was a shock to me, I had grown up with a relatively small extended family all central to Massachusetts and North America.
                Knowing that there was family on the other side of the world was exciting making the long journey even more worth it.

                <p>The journey to Australia was no doubt long. First a flight to Los Angeles in which we missed our connecting flight then the nearly 24 hour flight to 
                    Gold Coast Australia where my brother was. Once we arrived, we spent plenty of time exploring the beautiful and diverse landscapes of Australia.
                    We eventually hit Sydney where my family is. Immediately, we were greeted by a whole room of family members with traditional family style chinese
                    food as if we were home. My Mom was so blessed. She was together reunited with her closest cousin, Auntie Agnes, whom she hadn't seen since she was a child living in
                    China.

            <div class="aus-paragraph3">
                <p>I remember my time in Sydney was so memmorable, we spent the days roaming the city seeing the sites and some days with the cousins seeing parts of
                    their everyday lives. I not only fell in love with the city, but it made me feel more closer to my family than ever. I vividly remember one of my
                    families last nights in Australia, the cousins took us to their favorite italian and pizza restaurant. The restaurant was family owned covered in
                    images marking the generational ownership of the restaurant. This was the place where we learned about great grandfather, Rafael Mok. We sat for 
                    hours discussing our family history. As we sat around a large table sharing an array of Italian foods, we spoke of you. Auntie Agnes, Ting, and Doris 
                    shared stories of growing up and how, during the Japanese Occupation of China, you became a refugee and were later adopted into the Mok family, how 
                    you divorced in Hong Kong and moved to Cuba where you settled and started a new family. These revelations brought up questions and curiousities that
                    I had previously not thought of.
